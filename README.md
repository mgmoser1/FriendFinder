**A compatibility app built with Node and Express**

I know what keeps you up at night. In the wee hours of the morning there is nothing to distract you from **the** defining question of the 21st Century. The big one. The end all, be all. If you were a Muppet, which one would you be? Fear not, gentle reader. Knowledge awaits.


## Getting Started
This app has been deployed on Heroku at https://git.heroku.com/morning-hamlet-52684.git .


## Project Overview
This app uses Javascript, Express, and Path to present the user with a ten question survey and compares the user input to the answers of several Muppets who took the same quiz. It loops over all answers and compares each question's answer to those provided by each Muppet to find the best match. Once found, a modal with the Muppet's name and picture is displayed, thereby answering once and for all which Muppet they would be. (Except for if they get me. Just to leave a little Muppet mystery for a few people, I'm in there, too.)
